# Contributing to our cool app acoach :)

First of all, be kind and friendly with everyone. If you have questions, ask
them right away, don't get stucked in some odd issue for long time.

## Contributing with issues

If you see something that is broken (e.g. a bug) or if you see something that
you think we could do better you have two approaches for that depending on the depth:

- If you can do that in less than 10 minutes then do it and send a PR
- If you can't do that in less than 10 minutes, open an issue in the
[umpordez/acoach](https://github.com/umpordez/acoach/issues) without milestone
(we will prioritize/select the best milestone for you), you can add labels if you want

## Contributing to our current Milestone

We currently have all issues in the same place, the issues with `priority`
label are more critical, but you can get any that you want.

The workflow is basically:

- Access [`acoach/issues`](https://github.com/umpordez/acoach/issues) and find
an issue that fit in your current dev process
- Assign the issue to yourself
- Start by creating a new branch for your issue, try to be must clear as
possible, e.g; if you have an issue like `Implement login UI`, insted of creating
a branch called `issue-1`, create a branch called `login-ui` (`git checkout -b login-ui`)
- Do all your work on that branch and commit it whenever you want, when it's
done, send a Pull Request and add to the description all the info we need to
review

Whenever you need help or talk about some issue/workflow, please ask as soon as possible in Slack, don't get stucked.

Also always remember: *simplicity over complexity*, if you are writing a code and it's looking way to complex or you're doing *copy&paste* something is wrong and you must talk with someone.
